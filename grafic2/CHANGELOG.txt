Changed n3c in grafic2.inc to be consistent with the test.


Version 1.0, March 18, 2001
-----------

The initial release of GRAFIC2 includes the multiscale codes
grafic1 and grafic2, the linear GR code lingers (derivative from
linger_syn of COSMICS), and an image tool ic2gif.

Known deficiencies:

1. lingers doesn't do closed or open universes and it uses Peebles
recombination (probably okay for transfer functions and quadrupole
anisotropy).  These will be corrected.  Also, power.f (which reads
linger.dat for grafic1 and grafic2) will be made compatible with
CMBFAST transfer function output.
